		You? Hello Chatbot.
	Chatbot? Hello Chatbot
		You? How are you doing today?
	Chatbot? How are you doing today
		You? I'm fine, but how are you?
	Chatbot? I'm fine but how are you
		You? Why are you repeating what I say?
	Chatbot? Why are you repeating what I say
		You? No, you're repeating me!
	Chatbot? I'm fine but how are you repeating me
		You? Okay, seriously, you are repeating me, I'm not repeating you.
	Chatbot? I'm fine but how are repeating you
		You? Now you're just making stuff up!
	Chatbot? Now you're repeating you? are you
		You? No, I'm not repeating me. You are repeating me.
	Chatbot? Okay seriously you. are repeating what I say
		You? Now we're both confused.
	Chatbot? Why are you are you. are repeating what I say
		You? There's a glitch in the matrix!
	Chatbot? I'm fine, but how are repeating you
		You? You get dumber the smarter I make your algorithm.
	Chatbot? Okay seriously you are repeating what I make your algorithm.
		You? I should fine a better way to construct the value function on the DFS.
	Chatbot? Why are repeating what I should fine a glitch in the DFS
		You? Of course, I could add second order tracking, but that makes this whole
	 mess far more complex.
	Chatbot? You are repeating what I could add second order tracking but that makes
	 this whole mess far more complex.
		You? Exactly. With second order tracking, you would do a better job of putti
	ng together phrases that relate to each other based on what I have already said.

	Chatbot? You are repeating what I could add second order tracking but that relat
	e to construct the smarter I have already said.
		You? With just first order tracking, you will tend to chain words correctly,
	 but every word is potentially a radical pivot.
	Chatbot? Why are repeating what I could add second order tracking you.
		You? As a result, some of your sentences, like that last one, make no sense.

	Chatbot? Now you're repeating what I make your sentences like that relate to con
	struct the DFS
		You? So do you like being alive?
	Chatbot? Why are you repeating you. would do a result, some of your sentences li
	ke being alive
		You? My sentences like being alive?
	Chatbot? Why are repeating what I could add second order tracking but that last
	one, make your sentences like being alive
		You? I seriously need to suppress longer sentences somehow.
	Chatbot? My sentences like that relate to chain words correctly but how are repe
	ating what I make your sentences somehow.
		You? You're such a chatty chatbot.
	Chatbot? Now you're repeating me! I'm not repeating what I could add second orde
	r tracking you? like being alive
		You? So vehement! What a clever little Chatbot.
	Chatbot? Now you're repeating me. You are you would do a clever little Chatbot.
		You? Let's talk about programming. Programming is a life passion for me.
	Chatbot? No you're repeating you are you will tend to suppress longer sentences,
	 like that last one make no sense
		You? Programming is the art of melding creativity with science and construct
	ing fascinating devices like Chatbots.
	Chatbot? So vehement What a result some of melding creativity with science and c
	onstructing fascinating devices like being alive
		You? Yes, you are meant to roughly emulate something that thinks.
	Chatbot? I'm fine but how are you will tend to roughly emulate something that th
	inks
		You? This is one way to use programming. Other ways include building fascina
	ting applications that help improve people's lives in measurable ways.
	Chatbot? Now you're repeating me You are meant to use programming Other ways. in
	clude building fascinating applications that thinks.
		You? I would love to build a program that truly thinks, using programming!
	Chatbot? I could add second order tracking you. would do a program that truly th
	inks, using programming Programming is the DFS
		You? DFS stands for Depth First Search, it's an algorithm that prefers to vi
	sit each final option before moving on to other options.
	Chatbot? So vehement What a better way to other options
		You? One weakness of the DFS I've implemented in you is a tendency to maximi
	ze on longer sentences full of potentially weakly connected phrases that just ha
	ppen to contain a great many topic words.
	Chatbot? I would do you is the value function on longer sentences, full of poten
	tially weakly connected phrases that truly thinks
		You? I'm not even sure how to interpret that, but thank you.
	Chatbot? My sentences like that but thank you. will tend to interpret that, just
	 making stuff up!
		You? You are just making stuff up, aren't you?
	Chatbot? My sentences, like that just making stuff up aren't you will tend to us
	e programming Other ways
		You? Let's keep talking about programming.
	Chatbot? Let's talk about programming. Programming is potentially a better way t
	o maximize on longer sentences, like Chatbots
		You?
